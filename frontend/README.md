# WalletRep – Wallet Reputation & Score

WalletRep is a frontend React application that allows users to check the reputation and risk score of Ethereum-style wallets, either individually or in bulk. It uses a mock API for scoring and is designed to be demo-ready and easy to extend with a real backend later.

- Download results as a CSV file

### UI & UX
- Clean, minimal design
